# Pearl-Tutorial

An interactive, beginner-friendly Perl tutorial you can run locally.

## What this is

This repository contains a small interactive Perl script that walks through
fundamental Perl concepts (scalars, arrays, hashes, regex, file I/O, references,
and simple exercises). It's intentionally minimal so learners can step through
it and try the exercises.

## Prerequisites

- Perl (5.x) installed and available on your PATH. On macOS Perl is usually
	preinstalled. To check: `perl -v`.

## Files

- `perl_tutorial.pl` â€” the interactive tutorial script (run with Perl).

## How to run

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```sh
perl perl_tutorial.pl
```

The script is interactive: it prompts for short inputs for exercises.

## Learning objectives

- Understand basic Perl data types: scalars, arrays, hashes.
- Practice loops, conditionals, subroutines, and regex.
- See simple file I/O and references.
- Run small exercises to reinforce each section.

## Notes

- The script is intentionally simple and safe for beginners. It does basic
	input validation for a few prompts and warns on file write errors.

## Contribution

If you'd like to improve sections, add more exercises, or convert this into
non-interactive unit tests, feel free to open a PR.
